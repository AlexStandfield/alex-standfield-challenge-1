# Code Refactor Starter Code
<!-- For this assignment I went in and started looking at the html and the live sight. 

I got a feel of the website and its functionality then I went into the HTML and started making changes. 

I made changes in the html that clearly explain the format of the website in the code itself. 

I also added alt attributes to all the img to explain what is being presented. -->
